# stencyl-platformer-demo

This repo contains the assets, the exported `.stencyl` file, and the compiled demo for a simple platformer game about a jumping frog that avoids spikes and eats flies. I prepared it for a video game development class of middle school students in Summer 2018.

These files are for the [Stencyl](http://www.stencyl.com/) video game development tool. The assets I made in [Krita](https://krita.org/en/).
